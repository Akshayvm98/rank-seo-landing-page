          Imagine you write two articles about keyword research. One is a
          beginner guide, the other is a tips-and-tricks post. Both target
          &quot;keyword research.&quot; You expect double the ranking power.
          Instead, Google gets confused about which page to show and neither
          one ranks as well as it should.

      <Section id="what-is-it" title="What is keyword cannibalization?">
        <Paragraph>
          Keyword cannibalization happens when two or more pages on your site
          target the same keyword or closely related keywords with the same
          search intent. Instead of one strong page, you have multiple weaker
          pages splitting the signals Google uses to determine rankings.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Think of it like sending two runners from the same team to race in
          the same lane. They get in each other&apos;s way, and neither
          finishes as fast as they could have alone.

          is critical here. If two keywords trigger the same set of results on

            answer: (
              <p>
                The most effective fixes are merging competing pages into one
                stronger page, redirecting the weaker page to the stronger one,
                or re-targeting one page to a different keyword with distinct
                intent. The right choice depends on the quality and performance
                of each page.

                In most cases, yes. It splits your ranking signals and confuses
                Google about which page to show. However, if your site is so
                authoritative that multiple pages rank on the first page for the
                same keyword, cannibalization may not be a problem. For most
                sites, consolidation leads to better results.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes, but it is rare and usually only happens for very
                authoritative domains. For most sites, Google picks one page to
                show per query. If you have multiple pages competing, Google
                often picks a suboptimal one or ranks both lower than a single
                consolidated page would rank.

              <p>
                Do not just delete them. If a page has backlinks, traffic, or
                useful content, deleting it wastes those assets. Instead, merge
                the content into the stronger page and set up a 301 redirect
                from the old URL. This preserves the link equity and improves
                the remaining page.

              <p>
                Create a keyword map that assigns one primary keyword to each
                page. Before writing new content, check whether you already
                have a page targeting that keyword. If you do, update the
                existing page instead of creating a new one. Regular content
                audits help catch new overlaps as your site grows.
