          If you have ever sat down to write a page and wondered how many
          keywords to target, you are not alone. It is one of the most common
          SEO questions, and it gets a confusing range of answers.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Some guides say you should only focus on one keyword. Others tell you
          to stuff as many as possible into the page. Neither approach is quite
          right, and both can lead to content that underperforms.

          The real answer has nothing to do with hitting a specific number. It

        <Paragraph>
          The confusion comes from how SEO used to work compared to how it
          works now. And most advice online still mixes the two.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Old SEO was keyword-centric.</strong> A decade ago, you would
          create one page for &quot;best running shoes,&quot; another for
          &quot;top running shoes,&quot; and another for &quot;best shoes for
          running.&quot; Each page targeted one exact keyword. It worked because
          Google was not smart enough to understand that all three meant the
          same thing.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Modern SEO is topic-centric.</strong> Google now understands
          meaning, not just exact words. It groups related searches together
          and expects a single well-written page to cover an entire topic. If
          you still create separate pages for every keyword variation, you end
          up competing against yourself.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The other source of confusion is the word &quot;targeting.&quot; When
          people say &quot;target a keyword,&quot; they often mean &quot;mention
          it in the title and repeat it throughout the page.&quot; But that is
          not how targeting works anymore. Targeting a keyword means creating

          The straightforward answer: one primary keyword, supported by a
          handful of closely related variations and semantic terms. But the
          better way to think about it is this: you are not targeting multiple
          keywords. You are targeting a topic.

          <strong>Your primary keyword</strong> is the single term that best
          describes what the page is about. It goes in your title tag, your H1,
          your URL, and your meta description. This is the anchor of the page.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Supporting keywords</strong> are close variations of your
          primary keyword. If your primary keyword is &quot;how to find easy
          keywords,&quot; supporting keywords might include &quot;find easy SEO
          keywords,&quot; &quot;easy keywords to rank for,&quot; or &quot;simple
          keywords for beginners.&quot; These share the same intent and can be
          woven into subheadings and body text naturally.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Semantic keywords</strong> are terms that are conceptually
          related to your topic. For a page about keyword targeting, semantic
          keywords might include &quot;search volume,&quot; &quot;keyword
          density,&quot; &quot;topic clusters,&quot; and &quot;content
          optimization.&quot; Google uses these to understand the depth and

              <p>
                Target one primary keyword per page, supported by 3 to 8
                closely related variations. The goal is to cover a single topic
                thoroughly, not to hit a specific keyword count.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Pages that rank well for one keyword often rank for
                hundreds of related terms. This happens naturally when your
                content covers a topic comprehensively. You do not need to
                target each keyword individually.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Keyword stuffing, which means repeating a keyword
                unnaturally to try to manipulate rankings, can trigger
                Google&apos;s quality filters and hurt your rankings. Write
                naturally and focus on answering the search query thoroughly
                instead of forcing keywords into the content.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Only if the keywords have different search intent. If two
                keywords show similar search results on Google, they belong on
                the same page. Creating separate pages for similar keywords
                causes keyword cannibalization, where your own pages compete
                against each other.

            question: "What are semantic keywords and should I use them?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Semantic keywords are terms conceptually related to your main
                topic. For example, a page about keyword research would
                naturally mention terms like search volume, competition, and
                long-tail keywords. Including them helps Google understand your
                content depth. They should appear naturally, not be forced in.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Search both keywords on Google and compare the results. If the
                top results are mostly the same pages, the intent is the same
                and they belong on one page. If the results are completely
                different, the intent is different and you need separate pages.
