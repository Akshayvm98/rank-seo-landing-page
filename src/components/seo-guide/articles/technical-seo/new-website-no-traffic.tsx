        <Paragraph>
          New websites start with zero authority, zero trust signals, and zero
          indexed pages. There is no history for Google to evaluate, no backlinks
          vouching for your content, and no engagement data showing that people
          find your site useful.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Google needs time to discover your site, evaluate your content, and
          decide whether it deserves to rank. This process does not happen
          overnight, and understanding the timeline helps set the right
          expectations.

        <Paragraph>
          Google gives preference to established domains with a track record.
          Sites that have been around for years, have earned backlinks, and have
          consistent publishing histories get the benefit of the doubt. A brand
          new domain has none of that.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A new domain has no history, no backlinks, and no engagement data for
          Google to evaluate. You are starting from a position where Google has
          no reason to trust your content over the thousands of established pages
          already ranking.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify this:</strong> Your domain is less than 6
          months old and you have fewer than 20 indexed pages. You are seeing
          close to zero impressions in Google Search Console.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Focus on consistency. Publish quality
          content on a regular schedule. Build internal links between your pages.
          Be patient. Authority is earned over months, not days. Every quality
          article you publish adds to your site's credibility in Google's eyes.

        <Paragraph>
          Google may not have discovered or indexed your pages yet. If your pages
          are not in Google's index, they cannot appear in search results at all.
          This is one of the most common reasons new websites get zero traffic.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          New sites with no backlinks and no sitemap are effectively invisible to
          Google's crawlers. Without external links pointing to your site and
          without a sitemap telling Google what pages exist, discovery can take
          weeks or even months.

          Publishing content without targeting specific search queries means you
          are hoping to get found by accident. Without a keyword strategy, your
          pages are not aligned with what people are actually searching for.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify this:</strong> Look at each page on your site
          and ask yourself what keyword it targets. If you cannot name the
          primary keyword for each page, or if your pages do not target any
          specific keywords at all, this is likely a major factor.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Do keyword research before creating
          content. Every page should target a specific keyword with validated
          search volume. Start with topics your audience is actually searching
          for, then create content that directly answers those queries.

        <Paragraph>
          Going after terms like "project management software" or "best CRM"
          when you have a brand new domain is a losing strategy. These keywords
          are dominated by established companies with massive backlink profiles
          and years of authority.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify this:</strong> Search your target keywords in

          not outrank them with a new site, no matter how good your content is.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Switch to long-tail, low-competition
          keywords. Target terms where the top results are forums, thin articles,
          or small sites. These are keywords where a well-written, comprehensive
          article from a new site can realistically compete and win.

        <Paragraph>
          A site with 3 pages cannot compete with one that has 50 well-optimized
          articles. Each page on your site is a potential entry point from
          Google. More quality pages means more chances to rank for different
          search queries and more opportunities to attract visitors.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify this:</strong> Count your published, indexable
          pages. If it is under 10, you simply do not have enough content to
          generate meaningful traffic. Each missing page is a missed opportunity
          to rank for a keyword your audience is searching for.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Aim for 2 to 4 quality articles per
          month. Focus on topics your audience searches for and make sure each
          article targets a specific keyword. Quality always beats quantity, but
          you need a minimum volume of content to give Google enough to work

        <Paragraph>
          Pages with no internal links are hard for Google to discover and
          evaluate. Internal links help Google understand how your pages relate
          to each other and which topics your site covers. Without them, each
          page is an isolated island that Google may never find.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify this:</strong> Check if your pages link to each
          other. If most pages are standalone with no connections to other
          content on your site, this is a problem that is holding back both
          crawling and ranking.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Every page should link to 3 to 5
          related pages on your site. Build topic clusters where articles support
          each other. When you publish a new article, go back and add links to
          it from relevant existing pages.

          Writing what you want to say instead of what searchers want to read is

        <Paragraph>
          Publishing 5 articles in week one and then nothing for 3 months sends
          a bad signal. Google crawls consistent sites more frequently because it
          learns to expect new content on a regular schedule.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Inconsistent publishing also hurts your ability to build momentum.
          Traffic growth from SEO compounds over time, and long gaps between
          content reset that compounding effect.

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Set a realistic schedule, even if it is
          just 1 article per week, and stick to it. Consistency compounds. A
          site that publishes one good article every week for 6 months will
          almost always outperform a site that publishes 20 articles in one week

            question: "How long does it take for a new website to get traffic?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Most new websites see their first organic traffic within 3 to 6
                months if they are targeting low-competition keywords and
                publishing consistently. Meaningful traffic growth usually begins
                around month 6 to 12. The timeline depends on content quality,
                keyword difficulty, and how quickly Google indexes your pages.

            question: "Why is my new website not showing on Google?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                The most common reasons are that your pages are not indexed, you
                have not submitted a sitemap, or there are no internal links
                helping Google discover your content. Check Google Search Console
                to verify which pages are indexed and fix any issues.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Focus on low-competition keywords where the top results are
                weak. Create content that is more thorough and better structured
                than what currently ranks. Build strong internal links. Backlinks
                help, but you can rank for easy keywords without them.

            answer: (
              <p>
                There is no minimum, but more quality pages means more chances to
                rank. Aim for at least 15 to 20 well-optimized articles within
                your first 3 to 6 months. Each page targeting a specific keyword
                is another entry point from Google.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes, but only for low-competition keywords. New sites cannot
                compete for competitive terms. Target long-tail keywords with
                weak results and you can see first-page rankings within 2 to 4
                months.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Both have their place. SEO takes longer but builds a compounding
                asset. Paid ads give immediate traffic but stop when you stop
                paying. The smartest approach for most new sites is to start SEO
                early for long-term growth while using small ad budgets for
                immediate validation.
