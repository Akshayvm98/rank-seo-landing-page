        <Paragraph>
          If Google has not indexed your page, it does not exist in search
          results. No amount of keyword optimization, link building, or content
          quality matters if Google never adds the page to its database.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Indexing is the foundation of everything in SEO. Before your page can
          rank for anything, Google needs to discover it, crawl it, evaluate it,
          and decide it is worth storing. When that process breaks down, your
          content stays invisible.
        </Paragraph>

          A page can be crawled but not indexed. This happens when Google visits
          the page but decides it is not worth including. In Google Search
          Console, you will see statuses like "Discovered, currently not indexed"
          or "Crawled, currently not indexed." Both mean Google knows about your
          page but has chosen not to store it.

          These two statuses have different root causes. &quot;Discovered&quot;

          If a page has no internal links pointing to it, Google may not discover

                It varies. Some pages get indexed within hours, while others take
                days or weeks. New sites with little authority typically wait
                longer. Submitting the URL through Search Console and adding
                internal links from indexed pages can speed up the process
                significantly.

                If Google is not indexing your site at all, check for a sitewide
                noindex tag, a robots.txt file blocking Googlebot, or server
                errors preventing crawling. Make sure your site is verified in

                You can use the Request Indexing button in Search Console for
                important pages, but it is not scalable. Focus on fixing the root
                cause, whether that is poor internal linking, missing sitemaps,
                or content quality. Google should discover and index your pages
                naturally if your site is well-structured.

                Yes. Google evaluates whether a page adds enough value to be
                included in the index. Pages with very little content, content
                that closely matches other pages, or content that does not match
                any real search intent are often crawled but not indexed.

                There is no universal ratio. The goal is to have all of your
                valuable, unique pages indexed and to keep low-value pages like
                empty tags, duplicates, and admin pages out of the index. Compare
                the number of indexed pages in Search Console to the number of
                pages in your sitemap to spot gaps.

                &quot;Discovered, currently not indexed&quot; means Google knows
