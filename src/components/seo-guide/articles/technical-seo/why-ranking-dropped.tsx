        <Paragraph>
          Not every ranking change is a problem. Search positions fluctuate
          naturally as Google continuously re-evaluates content across the web.
          A drop of one or two positions for a few days is normal and usually
          corrects itself.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A real problem is a sustained drop of five or more positions, or a
          loss of first-page rankings that lasts more than a week. That kind of
          movement signals something changed, either on your site, on
          competitors&apos; sites, or in Google&apos;s algorithm.
        </Paragraph>
        <DataCard
          items={[
            { label: "Normal fluctuation", value: "1-2 positions", note: "Resolves within days, no action needed" },
            { label: "Minor drop", value: "3-5 positions", note: "Monitor for a week, then investigate" },
            { label: "Significant drop", value: "5+ positions", note: "Investigate immediately, likely a real issue" },
          ]}
        />
        <Paragraph>
          The best place to confirm a real drop is the Google Search Console
          performance report. Filter by page and compare the drop period to the
          previous period. This tells you exactly which pages and queries lost
          ground.

      <Section id="algorithm-update" title="Google algorithm update">
        <Paragraph>
          Google rolls out core updates several times per year. These updates
          re-evaluate content quality, relevance, and authority across the
          entire web. A single core update can reshuffle rankings for thousands
          of keywords overnight.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify:</strong> Check whether the timing of your
          drop aligns with a confirmed Google update. The Google Search Status
          Dashboard and major SEO news sites publish update announcements and
          timelines. If the dates match, an algorithm change is the likely
          cause.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix:</strong> Do not make panic changes. Review
          Google&apos;s guidance on helpful content. Focus on improving content
          quality, depth, and originality. Strengthen your E-E-A-T signals
          (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). Recovery
          from a core update often takes until the next core update rolls out,
          so patience is essential.

          Content that was once the best result for a keyword can lose ground

          Stats from 2022 in a 2026 article signal staleness to both users and

        <Paragraph>
          Rankings are relative. Even if you did nothing wrong, competitors
          getting better pushes you down. SEO is not a static achievement. It
          is a continuous competition where the top positions go to whoever

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify:</strong> Search your target keyword and

          subtopics you missed?

        <Paragraph>
          Backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking signals. If sites that
          linked to you remove those links, your authority drops and rankings
          can follow.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify:</strong> Check the Links report in Google
          Search Console or use third-party tools to monitor backlink changes
          over time. Look for a correlation between when links were lost and
          when rankings dropped.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix:</strong> Reach out to recover lost links if
          possible. Create new linkable content such as original research,
          data, or tools that naturally attract links. Focus on building
          authority through consistent quality rather than one-time link
          acquisition campaigns.

          Crawl errors, indexing problems, server downtime, broken redirects,

          issues prevent Google from accessing or properly evaluating your
          content.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify:</strong> Check the coverage report and URL
          Inspection tool in Google Search Console. Look for spikes in errors
          around the same time as the ranking drop. Pay attention to server
          error rates, crawl anomalies, and any new noindex directives.
        </Paragraph>

          <strong>How to fix:</strong> Resolve crawl errors, fix redirect

        <Paragraph>
          Removing or changing internal links during a redesign or content
          reorganization can break the authority flow to important pages. If a
          page that previously had strong internal links suddenly loses them,
          Google may re-evaluate its importance and drop its rankings.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify:</strong> Check whether recent site changes
          affected the internal linking structure. Use the Links report in
          Search Console to see how many internal links currently point to the
          affected pages. If the number dropped recently, that is likely a
          contributing factor.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to fix:</strong> Restore internal links to affected
          pages. Make sure important pages have at least three to five internal

            question: "Why did my rankings drop overnight?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Overnight drops are usually caused by a Google algorithm update,
                a technical issue on your site (like an accidental noindex tag
                or server error), or a major change you made to the page. Check
                Search Console for errors and look for confirmed algorithm
                updates around the same date.

            answer: (
              <p>
                It depends on the cause. Technical fixes can restore rankings in
                one to two weeks. Content improvements typically take two to six
                weeks. Recovery from algorithm updates can take months and may
                require waiting for the next core update.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Core updates can significantly reshuffle rankings across
                entire industries. If your content is thin, outdated, or not
                matching user intent, an update is more likely to hurt you.
                Sites with high-quality, helpful content tend to recover or
                improve.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Start with Google Search Console. Compare performance data
                between the drop period and the previous period. Check for crawl
                errors, indexing issues, and manual actions. Then look at
                whether an algorithm update was confirmed around the same date.
                Finally, review any recent changes you made to the site.

            question: "Can I recover lost traffic after a ranking drop?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                In most cases, yes. The key is identifying the specific cause
                and making targeted fixes. Technical issues are the fastest to
                recover from. Content quality issues take longer. The worst
                approach is to make random changes without diagnosing the actual
                problem first.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Take action, but strategically. First diagnose the cause. If it
                is a technical issue, fix it immediately. If it is related to an
                algorithm update, analyze what changed in the top results and
                improve your content accordingly. Avoid making panic changes
                without understanding the root cause.
