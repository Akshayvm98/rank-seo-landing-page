        <Paragraph>
          Before diagnosing why your site is not ranking, it helps to understand
          the three-step process Google follows for every page on the web.

          The key signals Google uses to determine ranking order include
          relevance to the search query, content quality and depth, domain
          authority and backlinks, user experience, and technical health. A
          weakness in any of these areas can prevent your pages from ranking.

        <Paragraph>
          New domains start with zero trust signals. Google has no history to
          evaluate, no backlinks to measure, and no user engagement data to work
          with. It takes time for a new site to build enough credibility to
          compete in search results.

          number of backlinks pointing to your site, and how many pages Google
          has indexed. If your domain is under six months old with fewer than a
          handful of backlinks, low authority is likely the primary factor.

          If Google has not indexed a page, it cannot appear in search results at

          Common indexing blockers include noindex meta tags, robots.txt rules

        <Paragraph>
          One of the most common ranking mistakes is going after keywords that
          are too competitive for your site. If you are a new or small site
          trying to rank for broad, high-volume terms that established domains
          have held for years, you will struggle regardless of content quality.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The opposite problem also exists. Some sites target keywords with
          virtually no search volume, meaning even a number-one ranking would
          bring little traffic.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>How to identify this:</strong> Check Google Search Console to

          you intended to target. If there is a mismatch, or if you are not
          appearing at all for your target terms, your keyword strategy likely
          needs adjustment.

          Even if you target the right keyword, your page will not rank if its
          format does not match what Google rewards for that query. Google

        <Paragraph>
          For example, if the top results for your keyword are all comparison
          articles and you published a single product review, Google will not
          consider your page a good match. The same applies to listicles versus
          in-depth guides, tutorials versus product pages, and other format
          differences.

          Google rewards content that thoroughly covers a topic. If your page has

          but content that leaves questions unanswered will lose to content that

          Pages with no internal links pointing to them are effectively

          Backlinks remain one of Google&apos;s strongest ranking signals. When

            answer: (
              <p>
                The most common reasons are targeting keywords that are too
                competitive, thin content that does not cover the topic well
                enough, poor internal linking, technical issues preventing
                indexing, and a lack of backlinks or authority. Most of these are
                fixable with targeted improvements.

            question: "How long does it take to rank on Google?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                For new websites, expect 3 to 6 months for initial rankings on
                low-competition keywords. More competitive terms can take 6 to
                12 months or longer. Established sites with existing authority
                often see improvements in 1 to 3 months.

            question: "Can a new website rank quickly?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes, but only for low-competition keywords. New sites cannot
                compete with established domains for competitive terms. Focus on
                long-tail keywords with weak competition and build authority over
                time.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Backlinks remain one of Google&apos;s strongest ranking
                signals. However, quality matters far more than quantity. A few
                links from relevant, authoritative sites are worth more than
                hundreds of low-quality links.

            answer: (
              <p>
                If you have been doing SEO for several months with no results,
                the most likely causes are targeting keywords that are too
                competitive, not matching search intent, or technical issues
                preventing Google from properly crawling and indexing your site.
                Audit each area systematically.

                Check Google Search Console for indexing errors, crawl issues,
                and performance data. Use PageSpeed Insights to test loading
                speed. Compare your content depth and format against top-ranking
                competitors for your target keywords.
