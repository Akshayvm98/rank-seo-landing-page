        <Paragraph>
          When Google Search Console shows a page as &quot;Discovered, currently
          not indexed,&quot; it means Google found the URL, usually through your
          sitemap or internal links, but has not crawled it yet. The page is in
          Google&apos;s queue, but Google has decided it is not worth visiting
          right now.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          This is different from &quot;Crawled, currently not indexed,&quot;
          where Google actually visited the page but chose not to store it. With
          &quot;Discovered, not indexed,&quot; Google has not even looked at the
          content yet. It is a priority problem, not a quality problem.

        <Paragraph>
          Crawl budget is the number of pages Google will crawl on your site
          within a given time period. It is determined by two factors: crawl
          rate limit, which is how fast Google can crawl without overloading
          your server, and crawl demand, which is how much Google wants to crawl
          based on the perceived value of your content.

          For small sites with under a few hundred pages, crawl budget is rarely
          an issue. But for larger sites, or sites with many auto-generated or

            answer: (
              <p>
                It means Google found the URL, usually through your sitemap or
                internal links, but has not crawled it yet. Google knows the page
                exists but has decided it is not a priority to visit right now.

            answer: (
              <p>
                No. &quot;Discovered, not indexed&quot; means Google has not even
                visited the page yet. &quot;Crawled, not indexed&quot; means
                Google visited it and decided not to store it. The first is a
                priority problem. The second is a quality problem.

            answer: (
              <p>
                It depends on your site&apos;s authority and crawl budget. Some
                pages move from Discovered to Indexed within days. Others stay
                stuck for weeks or months. Adding strong internal links and
                requesting indexing can speed up the process.

            answer: (
              <p>
                It can help for individual pages, but it is not a scalable
                solution. Google limits daily requests. The real fix is
                improving internal linking, cleaning up low-value pages, and
                building site authority so Google naturally prioritizes your
                content.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. If your site has more URLs than your crawl budget can
                handle, Google queues the lower-priority ones. Publishing
                hundreds of pages quickly or having a bloated sitemap with
                low-value URLs makes this worse. Focus on quality over quantity.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Only if the pages are genuinely low-value. If the content is
                good and serves a purpose, keep it and work on improving
                internal links and site authority. If the pages are thin,
                duplicated, or no longer relevant, removing or consolidating
                them frees up crawl budget for your important content.
