      <Section id="what-it-means" title="What impressions but no clicks actually means">
        <Paragraph>
          An impression is counted every time your page appears in someone's
          search results. They do not need to scroll to it or even notice it. If
          Google showed your URL for a query, that counts as an impression.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A click is counted when someone actually taps on your result and visits
          your page.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The ratio between these two numbers is your click-through rate, or CTR.
          If your page gets 1,000 impressions and 20 clicks, your CTR is 2%.

        <Paragraph>
          High impressions with low clicks means one of two things: either your
          page is showing up for the right queries but not compelling people to
          click, or it is showing up in positions where very few people look.
          Both situations are fixable once you identify the specific cause.

          The meta description is the two lines of text below your title in

          A page going from 2% to 5% CTR on 10,000 impressions means 300 extra
          clicks per month with zero additional content.

            answer: (
              <p>
                It depends on your ranking position. Position 1 averages around
                27% CTR, position 3 around 10%, and position 10 around 2%. If
                your CTR is significantly below the average for your position,
                there is room to improve. A page at position 5 with 1% CTR is
                clearly underperforming.

            answer: (
              <p>
                The most common reasons are a weak title tag that does not
                attract attention, a missing or generic meta description, ranking
                too low on the page for anyone to notice, or a mismatch between
                your content and what the searcher is looking for. All of these
                are fixable with targeted optimizations.

                Yes, significantly. The top result gets roughly 27% of clicks,
                while position 10 gets about 2%. Each position you move up can
                increase CTR by 2 to 5 percentage points. If you are below
                position 5, improving your ranking should be the priority over
                optimizing your snippet.

              <p>
                Start by rewriting title tags on your highest-impression pages.
                Make them specific, benefit-driven, and under 60 characters.
                Write compelling meta descriptions. Match search intent by
                studying what format the top results use. Add structured data
                where appropriate. Then track changes over 2 to 4 weeks to
                measure impact.

          {
            question: "Should I change my title tags often?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Not constantly, but you should test changes on underperforming
                pages. When you update a title, note the date and monitor CTR in
                Search Console for 2 to 4 weeks. If CTR improves, keep it. If
                not, try another variation. Avoid changing titles on pages that
                are already performing well.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. While meta descriptions do not directly affect rankings,
                they directly affect whether someone clicks on your result. A
                well-written description that clearly states what the page offers
                can measurably increase CTR, especially for pages in positions 3
                to 7 where multiple results compete for attention.
