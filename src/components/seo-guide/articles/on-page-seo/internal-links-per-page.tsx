          The question &quot;how many internal links should a page have&quot;

        <Paragraph>
          Google has never published a specific limit or recommendation for
          internal links per page. In the past, there was informal guidance
          about keeping total links (internal plus external) under roughly 100
          per page, but Google has said this is no longer a hard rule.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The real constraint is not a number. It is usefulness. Every link
          should help the reader find something relevant. If a link does not
          add value at that point in the content, it should not be there,
          regardless of whether you are at 3 links or 30.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Overlinking means adding more internal links to a page than is
                useful for the reader. It creates a cluttered reading
                experience and reduces the SEO value of each individual link.
                If a page has links in every other sentence, it is probably
                overlinked.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Internal links help Google discover pages, understand
                content relationships, and distribute authority across your
                site. Pages with strong, relevant internal links from
                authoritative pages tend to rank better than isolated pages.

                Link to pages that are genuinely relevant to the current
                content. Ask: would a reader benefit from visiting this page at
                this point? Prioritize your most important pages (those you
                want to rank) and make sure they receive internal links from
                related, high-authority content.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Pillar pages are designed to be hub pages that link out to
                all subtopics within a cluster. They naturally have more links
                (15 to 25) because their purpose is navigation and overview.
                Blog posts should have fewer, more focused links (3 to 10)
                within the body content.
