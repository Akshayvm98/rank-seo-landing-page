          Most sites have internal linking issues they do not know about.
          Orphan pages with zero links pointing to them. Important pages
          buried three clicks deep. Broken links that lead nowhere. These
          problems accumulate quietly and affect how Google crawls, indexes,
          and ranks your content.

        <Paragraph>
          An internal link audit is a systematic review of how pages on your
          site link to each other. It examines which pages are well-connected,
          which are isolated, which links are broken, and whether your linking
          structure supports the way you want Google to understand your
          content.

        <Paragraph>
          Think of it as a health check for your site&apos;s nervous system.
          Links are how information and authority flow between pages. When
          connections are weak or broken, the whole system underperforms.

          Internal link audits are not a one-time task. As your site grows,
          new gaps appear. Pages get deleted, URLs change, and new content
          needs to be connected. A quarterly audit keeps your linking
          structure healthy and your rankings strong.

            answer: (
              <p>
                An internal link audit is a systematic review of how pages on
                your site link to each other. It identifies orphan pages,
                broken links, weak connections, and anchor text issues that
                may be hurting your SEO performance.

            question: "How often should I audit internal links?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                At least once per quarter. If your site publishes content
                frequently or has recently undergone major changes like
                redesigns, URL migrations, or content deletions, audit more
                often. Regular audits catch issues before they affect rankings.

            question: "What are orphan pages?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Orphan pages are pages on your site that have no internal links
                pointing to them. They can only be found through the sitemap or
                by typing the URL directly. Google often deprioritizes orphan
                pages for indexing because the lack of links signals they are
                not important.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes. Internal links help Google discover pages, understand
                content relationships, and distribute authority. Pages with
                strong internal linking from relevant pages tend to rank better
                than pages with few or no internal links.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Use a crawl tool like Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, or
                RankSEO&apos;s site audit feature to scan your site for links
                that return 404 errors or server errors. You can also check the
                Coverage report in Google Search Console for pages with crawl
                errors.

            answer: (
              <p>
                Yes, but it is time-consuming. For a small site with under 50
                pages, you can manually check links using a spreadsheet and the
                Links report in Search Console. For larger sites, automated
                tools are essential. They catch issues that manual review
                misses.
